# Intro

Cavensio introduces different ventilation automation systems for caves, vaults and bunkers.
It is pretty customizable solution and its reduced version is also applicable for home use.

*"- I can breathe"*  say our customers when we switch their new air system ON.

*"- Fresh air matters"* as we think and understand things in Cavensio.

Our engineers have strong software, hardware and telecommunications background.
In cooperation with experts in chemistry a microbiology we design and develop "pieces of advanced engineering"
and combine them into complex systems.

We are highly involved into the customer needs and practice both remote and on-site development all around the world.
For example, on the last project our engineers made several trips to the Batu Caves in Malaysia in order
to dive into the problems of extremely large cave series and systems.
And we hope to resume work trips when all this coronavirus hazard is over.
Nevertheless, now we are investing more resources into research and preparation of new features.

Our base solutions are open source. Everyone can use our public schemas and code for free.
But specific implementations made for the customer are private, unless, of course if the customer decides to make them public.
